  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-18 and REQ-19. The frontend Wallet.tsx removes the Add Funds/Receive Money form, its trigger button, and related state/mutation calls. The useQueries.ts hook file removes the useAddFundsToWallet mutation. The backend main.mo appears to have the addFundsToWallet function removed or stubbed. All preserved elements (balance display, Transfer to Locker, QR/Receive modals, SendMoneyForm, transaction history) remain in Wallet.tsx. The file summary for useQueries.ts explicitly states the useAddFundsToWallet mutation hook has been removed.",
