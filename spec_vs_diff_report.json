  "summary": "The diff implements the full Student Budget Manager app with backend Motoko actor and frontend React components. Most requirements are well-covered. A few specific acceptance criteria show gaps: the backend IncomeSource type uses a generic 'name: Text' rather than a typed variant (pocket_money | stipend | part_time); stable storage/canister upgrade persistence is not evidenced; deleteExpense is not shown; getDailySpendLimit backend function is not evidenced; the Digital Locker toggle in the Create Goal form does not appear to actually wire the locker activation to the goal creation call.",
